[[Cpre 230 Exam 1]]
## 5. Packet Analysis (tcpdump / Wireshark Concepts)

1. **Reading Basic Packet Captures**
    
    - Understand how to read source/destination IP addresses in a capture (e.g., packet 48 vs. packet 50).
    - Broadcast vs. unicast packets—who “receives” them.
2. **Address Resolution**
    
    - How a broadcast or multicast packet can target multiple machines.
    - The concept of ARP (Address Resolution Protocol) and “who gets the packet.”
3. **Following a Connection**
    
    - Identifying the source IP, destination IP, and whether a protocol is using broadcast/multicast vs. unicast.
    - Understanding how an IP might change after initial negotiations (DHCP, NAT scenarios, etc. — though not specifically mentioned, it’s good background knowledge).
